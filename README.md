# NucleoCV
CV Tracking and Targeting with the Pretrained YOLOv3 Model

# Motivation
I wanted to familiarize myself with OpenCV and ROS interactions. This project also implemented Micro-ROS on an STM32, which communicated with ROS on the workstation. The servo control code is from my [previous project with Micro-ROS](https://github.com/AJSmyth/ROSTeleop/tree/main/uROS-servo-v0.2).

# Demo
[Here](https://youtu.be/4TOTx0TvG4U) is a demo of the servo tracking.

# Sources
[This code](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/ObjectDetection-YOLO/object_detection_yolo.cpp) was exceptionally helpful in getting the YOLOv3 dnn up an running. The pretrained model configuration and weights included are from the [official YOLOv3 site](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
